poloka-flat
===========

poloka is a software package to process astronomical
images. poloka-flat is the flatfielding module
of the poloka suite. It contains:

* bias subtraction, flat and superflat building
* fringe map building (with PCA) and automatic fringe subtraction

It is a bit old and stale package since most observatories provide
calibration files nowadays. It also needs a full rewrite as most
poloka modules.

To install poloka-flat, see the INSTALL file.
